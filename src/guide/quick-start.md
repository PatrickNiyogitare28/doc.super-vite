Before you can start developing your awesome application you need to install the project's dependencies. Make sure you have Node (>= 10.13.0)


### Development

Once all dependencies have been installed you can start development. To start a development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) run:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
or
```sh
$ yarn dev
```

### Production

To run your application in production make sure to run a build first:

```sh
$ npm run build
```
or
```sh
$ yarn build
```

And then start you application with a provided port number (defaults to 3000 if not provided):

```sh
$ PORT=8080 npm run start
```


This will render static HTML pages into `./out`

### Todo
 The boiler plate incomming version will container a build in CLI to auto generate `components` and `views` plus connecting them to `store`
